# ML-algorithms (i will be not posting updates over my personal project file! so ignore the rough work)

machine learning algorithms from scratch in python 

try playing with the parameters !!!

For SGD i have implemented batch wise update, make batch_size = 1 to randomly pick a data point, if this is a wrong approach feel free to make pull request!
